This is a Southbit employee holding my laptop's SSD.

I possess the classes and preprocessing scripts, though they are arranged in a perplexing manner across various versions.

All results in the skripsie are as described therein.

I transitioned to Google Colab, which remains unfamiliar to me. I am actively constructing a repository to assist future students undertaking this challenge.

This will occur beyond the deadline, but not to deceive the markerâ€”that is my last intention.

I honestly intend to provide all scripts, classes, and algorithms mentioned, as this directly relates to my perceived professionalism and aids my fellow students.

All the best.
